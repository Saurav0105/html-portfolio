<h1>The best Movies according to Oggy</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
<p>With an estimated budget of $300 – $400 million, Marvel’s Infinity War is one of the most expensive movies ever created. Wondering why it cost so much? Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but those elaborate costumes and scenery were actually created digitally. It took 13 visual effects companies to create the incredibly detailed characters and scenes in this movie. Missing out on the astonishing visual effects in this movie is not only missing a huge part of what’s happening, but also missing out on brilliant works of art. The comparisons below show you what it actually looked like when filming, compared with what it looks like on screen. In many scenes, the footage was shot with green screens and minimal costuming, only to be digitally created later on.</p>

<h3>The Shape of Water</h3>
<p>With a merman as this film’s romantic lead, who falls in love with the mute protagonist, you won’t want to miss The Share of Water with audio description. Don’t believe us? Watch the trailer. Trey Harrell, Visual Effects Supervisor, explained that “Every single shot in the film where the amphibian-man is on-screen is digital in some capacity — at least his eyes.” “For a small handful of shots in the film, he’s entirely digital.” Anything that is that complex to create should definitely be described. Plus, aren’t you curious how one describes a romantic merman?</p>

<h3>Frozen</h3>
<p>I don’t know about you, but hearing Olaf described as “a carrot nosed snowman shuffling up to a purple flower” is enough of a reason that Frozen is a movie to watch with audio description. Thanks to Pixar’s Disney Movies Anywhere App, which allows users to watch most Pixar films with audio description, you can watch this all-time favorite with incredible descriptions. It really doesn’t get much cuter!</p>
